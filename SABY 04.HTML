 The 10 Best DISNEY+HOTSTAR Series and Shows to Watch Right Now : <br/>

#1. <U> GAME OF THRONES </U> <BR/>
<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">Game of Thrones won't need much of an introduction from us: it is the biggest TV phenomenon of the past decade, an impeccably-produced 
fantasy epic with a cast of dozens (including a good handful of non-humans) and an utterly gripping, twist-riddled plot spanning 
continents and years, and taking in several bloody wars along the way. It's truly great telly.
At present, the eight and final season has begun streaming on Now TV, with a new episode being added every Monday.
 Plus, all seven previous seasons are available to stream on Now TV, so if you're dying to discover what all the fuss
 is about (or you just fancy revisiting Westeros for a recap), you'd be Stark raving mad to miss out on the boxset. <BR/> </P>
 
 #2.<U> Billions</U><BR/>
 
<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">Think of Billions as the high-finance counterpart to House of Cards and you won't be far off the mark.
Damian Lewis and Paul Giamatti are superb as, respectively, the win-at-all-costs head of a massive hedge fund and the
 win-at-all-costs district attorney determined to put him behind bars, although both are thoroughly upstaged by
 the even better Maggie Siff as the woman who keeps both at the top of their game.It can get a bit bogged down in financial jargon - unless you're a hedge-fund manager yourself, you'll likely 
not understand a word of what's being discussed at times - but that’s never really a problem, because this isn't 
really a show about global financial markets. Well, no more so than Game of Thrones is really a show about dragons.
Instead, it's a show about power and whether the kind you can buy is more important than the kind you earn. Well worth a watch.
<BR/> </P>
#3.<U> Westworld (S02)</U><BR/>

<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">You thought Game of Thrones is the only best show out of HBO's stables? Think again. Westworld is a brilliant excuse for science
 fiction nuts to call in sick at work just to binge watch an entire season. You'll love this even if you ain't a big fan of science fiction,
 trust us. The plot revolves around a theme park which is a massive playground for anyone looking for a wild west adventure. It's populated
 with android hosts that are indistinguishable from humans and you can do anything and everything possible, given you have the 
 bucks to support your weird fantasies obviously.Amazing plot line backed by an amazing cast with the likes of Anthony Hopkins
 and Ed Harris filling your small screening will leave you waiting for season 3 in no time.<BR/></P>
 
 #4.<U> Homeland</U><BR/>
 
 <p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">If there were a graph that showed the tension levels of the tensest moment in the tensest thrillers in history, Homeland's producers 
 would have taken it, twisted it into an infinitesimally thin rope and used it to whip Stressed Eric's pulsing temple vein until it popped.
Homeland is tense. It's the story of the relationship between a CIA operative and a long-imprisoned ex-Marine, finally liberated from al
-Qaeda and returned to America as a war hero - a hero with an abundance of devastating secrets.It's packed with award-winning performances, believably flawed characters, just enough politics and more twists that a box of Curly-Wurlys. 
It loses its way in the middle seasons, occasionally skirting utter daftness, but it's always compulsive and entertaining – and the finale
 is breathtaking. To watch it is to learn to trust no-one, question everything and definitely not pursue a career as a spy. No fun at all,
 as it turns out.<BR/></P>

#5.<U> Who Is America?</U><BR/>

<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">The brazen Sasha Baron Cohen is back doing what he does best  make politicians and cultural icons smoke their own gas while throwing
 in a few laughs in heavily altered egos. Posing as various characters swinging from an Ex-convict turned fine artist to a pro-gun evangelist,
 the sketches are as real as they are bizarre. Making reality stranger than fiction is what he does best. <BR/></P>

#6.<U> AMERICAN CRIME STORY (S2): The Assassination of Gianni Versace </U><BR/>

<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">The second season of American Crime Story is here and it is very bit engrossing as season one that touched upon the trials of O J Simpson.
 This time, it is about the murder of Gianni Versace, the designer and the founder of the world-renowned brand Versace.Even if you think that the world knows what happened, the show really keeps you on the edge of your seat with its razor-sharp script and 
stellar acting by Darren Criss that will keep you cringing. Oh and Penélope Cruz is playing Donatella Versace and Ricky Martin takes in
 most of the screen time playing Gianni Versace's lover. Woah! <BR/></P>
 
 #7.<U> Big Little Lies</U><BR/>
 
 <p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">It is not often a TV series manages to land Hollywood royalty like Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon, but Big Little Lies is not your 
 average show. A miniseries (albeit one that, owing to its success, is now set for a second season) based on the novel of the same name,
 it is a briskly paced, tightly written, impeccably directed and lavish production with a fantastic soundtrack and a tone that hovers between
 somewhere menace, comedy and drama as it tracks a few months in the lives of a collection of families in swanky Californian coastal town Monterey.
The story opens in the aftermath of an apparent murder, but we donot know the victim and we don’t know the perpetrator – in fact, we donot
 know anything about the setting or the characters at all. This foreshadowing of violence is used brilliantly by veteran writer David E Kelley
 and director Jean-Marc Vallée (Dallas Buyer’s Club), as we are kept guessing as to what (or who) went down right up until the final reel of
 the final episode.<BR/></P>
 
 #8. <U>Band of Brothers</U><BR/>

<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">There is a strong argument to be made that the Golden Age of Television in which we now apparently live started here, with this glorious
 2001 World War II miniseries made by HBO (not to mention the BBC, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks).Boasting mammoth production values (at the time of its making, it was the most expensive TV show ever), a cast of dozens and an impeccable
 script, Band of Brothers tells the story of the war from the perspective of Easy Company, a US Army parachute company. Stretching from
 Easy jump training through their deployment on D-Day to the very end of the war in Europe, with each of its 10 episodes bookended by 
 interviews from the real-life veterans on which the story is based, it is compelling from start to finish, and will likely leave you in 
 floods of tears by the end.<BR/> </P>
 
 #9.<U> Dexter</U>
<BR/>
<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">Just what is it about Dexter? What is it, within an apparently straightforward contemporary drama series  police department employee with 
dark secret that let it get green lights all the way through to eight seasons and 96 episodes? Its sunny Miami setting, perhaps?
It is certainly not hampered by its charming titular protagonist and his goodly mix of attractive and/or amusing cohorts. Nor by its slick
 production. So it must be those moments when Dexter  both the character and show  hovers, knife already bloodied, unsure of itself And
then does what you thought it wouldnot.<BR/></P>

#10.<U> THE STRAIN</U><BR/>
<p STYLE="FONT-SIZE:20; COLOR:#000000;">Created by that master of creepy fantasy movies Guillermo del Toro with Chuck Hogan, and based on the books the pair wrote together, 
The Strain takes some familiar tropes - vampires, a deadly plague, the collapse of society, a rogue scientist battling to save the day - 
and manages to make a fresh-feeling show out of them.Four seasons are available on Hotstar and while it gets a bit muddled halfway through 
season two, it is well worth watching if you are a fan of fantasy horror. <BR/></P> </H5>
